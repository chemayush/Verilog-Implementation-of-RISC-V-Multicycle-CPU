# Verilog-Implementation-of-RISC-V-Multicycle-CPU

I implemented a Multicycle RISC-V CPU supporting the entire RV32I instruction set. The design features a multicycle architecture, using a single RAM for both instruction and data segments with automatic memory management. Key components include a shared ALU, a 32x32-bit Register File, and an optimized FSM Controller for handling all the instructions. The unified memory module supports all access widths (byte, halfword, word). It also includes a testbench which is used to verify the implementation of all the instructions.
